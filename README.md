# Gia â€” Mindful 20-20-20

**A Chrome Extension that helps users prevent digital eyestrain and cognitive fatigue by turning the 20-20-20 rule into an effortless, mindful habit.**  
Every 20 minutes, Gia reminds users to look 20 feet away for 20 seconds â€” using perceptually optimized design and adaptive AI for personalized wellness.

---

## Overview

Gia transforms evidence-based visual ergonomics into a seamless, AI-powered browser experience. Built with Chrome's built-in AI models, it blends behavioral science, accessibility, and human-centered design to support visual well-being without interrupting concentration.

---

## Condensed Summary

**Gia â€” Mindful 20-20-20** is based on research showing that 20-second gaze breaks every 20 minutes reduce digital eye strain and support ocular comfort. Drawing on the AOA's 20-20-20 rule and related studies in Contact Lens & Anterior Eye, Gia uses adaptive tone feedback and time-based prompts to turn screen breaks into a simple, science-backed wellness habit.

## Quick Demo Mode

Click **"ðŸš€ Try Demo"** on the first onboarding screen for an immediate experience:

**Break 1 (Mindful - 20 seconds):**
- Message: "Take a 20-second break. Look 20 feet away and blink gently. Let's take a little rest. I'll let you know when time is up."
- Voice: Slow (0.72x), calm pitch
- Shows circular countdown timer
- Audio notification when complete

**Break 2 (Goofy - 20 seconds):**
- Message: "Take a 20-second break. Look 20 feet away and blink gently. [Knock-knock joke]. I'll let you know when time is up."
- Voice: Normal speed (0.85x), energetic pitch
- Fun, entertaining content

**Break 3 (Long - 5 minutes):**
- Message: "Take 5. Time to touch grass but here's one for the road. Knock knock. Who's there? Cow says. Cow says who? No, a cow says moo!"
- Extended break demonstration

## Scientific Foundation & Design Rationale

Gia â€” Mindful 20-20-20 is grounded in peer-reviewed ocular research and official optometric guidance. Its design translates evidence-based insights about visual ergonomics, comfort, and behavior change into a user-friendly Chrome experience.

### 1. Preventing Digital Eye Strain

The American Optometric Association (AOA) recommends the 20-20-20 Ruleâ€”taking a 20-second break every 20 minutes to look at something approximately 20 feet awayâ€”to reduce digital eye strain. Research published in Contact Lens & Anterior Eye (2024) found that such structured gaze breaks improved tear-film stability and reduced symptoms of fatigue, dryness, and blurred vision compared to continuous screen use. 

**Takeaway:** Regular, brief visual pauses restore blink rate and ocular moistureâ€”principles Gia automates with gentle, time-based prompts.

### 2. Mindful Resets for Comfort and Recovery

Findings from Hot Towels: The Bedrock of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction Therapy (2023) show that warmth and rest improve tear-film lipid flow and comfort. Gia's longer "reset" breaks are conceptually inspired by this effect, encouraging users to step away and recalibrate attention.

### 3. Behavioral Adherence Through Emotional Design

Evidence-Based Teaching in Contact Lenses Education (2022) highlights that multimodal, tone-adapted feedback increases engagement and adherence. Gia applies this insight through selectable tone modesâ€”Mindful or Goofyâ€”that keep the experience personal and sustainable.

**Summary:**

| Insight | Evidence Source | Design Translation |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| AOA 20-20-20 guideline | Official optometric recommendation | 20-second short-break timer |
| Tear-film studies | Contact Lens & Anterior Eye (2024) | Eye-health rationale for gaze shifts |
| Warm-compress research | Meibomian gland therapy (2023) | Inspiration for long resets |
| Behavioral cue research | Evidence-Based Teaching (2022) | Tone-adaptive reminders for adherence |

**Design Philosophy:** Gia combines ocular science with human-centered design, transforming routine screen breaks into meaningful, evidence-informed digital wellbeing habits.
