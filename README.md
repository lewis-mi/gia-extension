## Overview
Gia transforms evidence-based visual ergonomics into a seamless, AI-powered browser experience. Built with Chrome's built-in AI models, it blends behavioral science, accessibility, and human-centered design to support visual well-being without interrupting concentration.

## Condensed Summary
Gia: The Good Intentions Assistant is based on research showing that 20-second gaze breaks every 20 minutes reduce digital eye strain and support ocular comfort. Drawing on the AOA's 20-20-20 rule and related studies in *Contact Lens & Anterior Eye*, Gia uses adaptive tone feedback and time-based prompts to turn screen breaks into a simple, science-backed wellness habit.

## Features
- **Time-Based Microbreaks** ‚Äî Automatically triggers brief wellness reminders every 20 minutes  
- **Adaptive Tone** ‚Äî Choose "Mindful" (calm, relaxing) or "Goofy" (energetic, fun) reminder styles  
- **Voice-Guided Breaks** ‚Äî Audio instructions with text-to-speech for hands-free breaks  
- **Long Breaks (Optional)** ‚Äî Extended 5-minute breaks during long sessions  
- **Demo Mode** ‚Äî Click "üöÄ Try Demo" on the first screen to experience Gia immediately  
- **Privacy-First** ‚Äî Runs entirely client-side, no data collection  

## Chrome Built-in AI APIs Used
- **Prompt API (active)** ‚Äî Voice command intent classification with local fallback  
- **Additional APIs (scaffolded, disabled by default)** ‚Äî Writer, Rewriter, Translator, Proofreader, Summarizer are present behind capability checks but not used in the default flow  

## Quick Demo Mode
Click "üöÄ Try Demo" on the first onboarding screen for an immediate experience:

**Break 1 (Mindful - 20 seconds):**
> "Take a 20-second break. Look 20 feet away and blink gently. I'll let you know when time is up."  
Slow, calm pitch ‚Äî circular countdown timer ‚Äî soft audio chime when complete

**Break 2 (Goofy Long - 30 seconds):**
> "Take 5. Time to touch grass but here's one for the road. Knock knock. Who's there? Cow says. Cow says who? No, a cow says moo!"  
Energetic, playful pitch ‚Äî demonstrates both goofy tone and extended break features  

## üß¨ Scientific & Cognitive Foundations
**Gia: The Good Intentions Assistant** combines research from optometry, cognitive psychology, and human-computer interaction to support digital well-being through perceptually optimized, AI-assisted design.

### üëÅÔ∏è Eye Health and Visual Ergonomics
The **American Optometric Association (AOA)** recommends the 20-20-20 Rule‚Äîtaking a 20-second break every 20 minutes to look about 20 feet away‚Äîto reduce digital eye strain.  
Studies in *Contact Lens & Anterior Eye* (2024) show that these structured gaze breaks improve tear-film stability and reduce fatigue and dryness.  
Gia automates this process through gentle, timed reminders that help restore blink rate and ocular comfort without disrupting concentration.

Longer ‚Äúreset‚Äù breaks draw inspiration from *Hot Towels: The Bedrock of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction Therapy* (2023), which links warmth and rest to improved comfort and tear-film health.  
Behavioral research from *Evidence-Based Teaching in Contact Lenses Education* (2022) further demonstrates that tone-adaptive feedback increases engagement, informing Gia‚Äôs **Mindful** and **Goofy** tone options.

### üß† Cognitive Load and Attention
Beyond physiology, Gia‚Äôs interface is grounded in perceptual and attention research.  
According to **Lavie and Tsal (1994)**, high perceptual load causes users to suppress peripheral cues‚Äîa reason visual alerts often go unnoticed during focused work. Gia counters this with **soft motion, subtle contrast, and rhythmic timing** that maintain awareness without distraction.  

Meanwhile, **Gorbatova et al. (2023)** describe *banner blindness*‚Äîa learned suppression of banner-like visuals regardless of salience. Gia avoids this by using conversational micro-cards and contextual timing rather than bright, ad-like banners, ensuring cues are perceived as supportive rather than intrusive.

**Design takeaway:** Gia integrates evidence from eye-health research and cognitive theory to create reminders that are gentle, visible, and trustworthy‚Äîsupporting focus while protecting visual comfort.
