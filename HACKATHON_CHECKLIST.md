## üìù Video Script (Under 3 Minutes)

### 0:00-0:30 - Introduction & Problem
"Meet Gia, an AI-powered Chrome extension that solves digital eye strain using the 20-20-20 rule. Built with 6 Chrome Built-in AI APIs, it provides personalized, intelligent break reminders. Let me show you how it works."

### 0:30-1:00 - Demo Mode & Installation
"First, I'll install the extension and click 'Try Demo' to skip setup. Now Gia starts automatically with AI-powered reminders."

### 1:00-1:30 - AI Features
"Watch how Gia generates unique break messages using the Writer API. Every reminder is personalized based on your tone preference - Mindful or Goofy. Here's a mindful reminder: 'Take a deep breath and look 20 feet away for 20 seconds.' And here's a goofy one: 'Time to rescue those tired eyes! Look far away and count to 20.' The Writer API creates these dynamically!"

### 1:30-2:00 - Voice Commands
"Gia also supports voice commands using the Prompt API. Watch me say 'snooze'... [show voice command]. The AI classifies my intent locally, no cloud needed."

### 2:00-2:30 - Advanced Features
"You can switch tones anytime - here I'm switching from Mindful to Goofy, and the Rewriter API adapts existing messages. The extension also uses Proofreader API to clean reflection journal entries, and Summarizer API to generate wellness insights. All processing happens on-device with Gemini Nano."

### 2:30-2:45 - Wrap-up
"Gia uses all 6 Chrome Built-in AI APIs to deliver a complete digital wellness solution. Try the demo at github.com/lewis-mi/gia-extension. Built with Chrome AI, powered by Gemini Nano."
